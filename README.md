# Hi, I'm Farhan 👋🏼👨🏼‍💻
Engineering student with great interest in web development. Diligent in studying the development of existing
technology. Has studied several programming languages related to web developers such as HTML, CSS, Javascript,
Bootstrap, PHP, and others. I'm a realist-creative thinker who likes to concept something out of the box but
achievable. I enjoy working collaboratively in a team and creating an inclusive environment with people at all levels of
an organization. I could adapt quickly to ever-changing situations.
